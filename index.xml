      <description>Using graphs when writing web content Inserting images into articles is something I have been battling with since my university days, when getting it right with LaTex was the ultimate challenge.
These days things have gotten much better, thanks to the use of formats like MarkDown or RestructuredText. These make it quite straightforward to include a JPG or PNG image in a document for the web (and can be used to produce PDF documents as well).</description>

      <description>Connecting Securely on the Web The HTTPS protocol allows one to connect to websites and web applications in a secure way. The absence of this de-facto standard usually triggers a big red warning on modern browsers. This means that using HTTPS is nowadays a must when creating web pages and web applications that face external users.
In practice, it is not straightforward to setup servers so that they use this secure protocol.</description>

      <description>Ever tried to paste something you just copied from your browser or from anywhere else on your system onto vim?

      <description>TL;DR: Spark executors setup is crucial to the performance of a Spark cluster. Executor parameters can be tuned to your hardware configuration in order to reach optimal usage. I built a small web app that allows you to do just that.

      <description>Hi!
I&amp;rsquo;m Matteo. A Physicist by training, I have studied in Italy and France and obtained my PhD at the Ecole Polytechnique in France, in the field of theoretical solid-state Physics. I started a promising career in academia but soon realized I needed to do something different for a living.
After a bit of soul-searching, I turned my attention to the field of AI and started working as a freelance Data Scientist.</description>
