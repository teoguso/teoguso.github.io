      <description>TL;DR: Spark executors setup is crucial to the performance of a Spark cluster. Executor parameters can be tuned to your hardware configuration in order to reach optimal usage. I built a small web app that allows you to do just that.
Spark executors Spark jobs make use of Executors, which are task-running applications, themselves running on a node of the cluster. Spark jobs are subdivided in tasks that are distributed to the executors according to the type of operations and the underlying structure of the data.</description>

      <description>Hi!
I&amp;rsquo;m Matteo. A Physicist by training, I have studied in Italy and France and obtained my PhD at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, in the field of theoretical solid-state Physics. I started a promising career in academia but soon realised I needed to do something different for a living.
After a bit of soul-searching, I turned my attention to the field of AI and started working as a freelance Data Scientist.</description>
